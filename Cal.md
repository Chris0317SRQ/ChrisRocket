# Calculus
## Intro
I initially saw this flow on Facebook because one of my friend commented on the post and I found it quite interesting. I never thought of a SOP to solve calculus because I haven't mastered it. Thus, I decided to try master it by designing an algorithm to determine the solving process of calculus problems.

## Note
