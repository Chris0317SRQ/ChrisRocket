# Implementation of regression and classification model
## What are the characteristics of an excellent neural network model
## Objectives
1. Primary objective: **Minimize the loss**
2. Avoid overfitting **without increasing the amount of data: Simplify the model**
3. Increase efficiency: **Adam**
4. Batch optimization: **Batch normalization and N-fold cross validation**
