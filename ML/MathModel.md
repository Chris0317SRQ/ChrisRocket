# Why Gradient descent but not the standard calculus method?

## Can we minimize the loss function by solving the hessian matrix but not these classical optimizers?

## Solving it with Quantum Computer (QAE+Qubo for Quantum Annealing)

## Is the time complexity of Quantum Annealing Eigensolver (QAE) + Qubo greater than Quantum Gradient Descent (QGD)?

>Note that QAE (Annealing) can solve the eigenvalues of a matrix with higher dimensions than VQE (Quantum gates). It is because the qubits aren't enough.
