# 2022 Summer
1. Machine Learning
2. Fundamentals
3. Quantum
4. Guidance, Control, and Navigation

## [Machine Learning](ML/ML.md)
Machine Learning is an essential tool in engineering. Thus, I learned and discussed it with a Chenggong Senior High School friend. We are so self-disciplined that we even discuss, and Google meets twice weekly.

## [Fundamental of Physics](Physics/Phy.md)
```java
Tree=Physics;
Tree.Root=NTHU_AP_Phy;
DFS(Tree.Root);
BFS(Tree.Root);
```
## [Mathematical Modeling and Control System](Control.md)
I started learning Control System in January 2022, right after NCKU admitted me. I started because of the work ADCS Design requires, which is an accident. However, I gradually fell in love with Control and Guidance, and I decided to DFS deeper into the knowledge of Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC).

## [Calculus](Calculus/Cal.md)
```java
Tree=Calculus;
Tree.Root=NTHU_AP_Cal;
DFS(Tree.Root);
BFS(Tree.Root);
```

## [Computer Science](CS/CS.md)
Participating in Taipei's Algorithm Academic ability contest was the beginning of my unique academic career. Perhaps studying a regular computer science course is a nice try.

## [Quantum Computer Science](CS/Quantum/Quantum_CS.md)
