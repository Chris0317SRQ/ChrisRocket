# What is time?
1. Time is one dimensional (For current scientific proofs)
2. Time varies over the moving speed of an object (Relativity)
3. Thus, Observer's velocity ⬆=> Δt of the Observed inertia frame ⬆
# Prequirements
> For motion of light clock
> Δt′ is the time interval between those same events, as measured by another observer, inertially moving with velocity v with respect to the former observer, v is the relative velocity between the observer and the moving clock, c is the speed of light

> For vectors orthogonal to the motion vector
> dy'=dy => dy/dt'
> dz'=dz => dz/dt'


> if motion vector differs from light speed vector
> =>decouple into u_x' and u_y'
> c=Amplitude(u_x',u_y')
## Lorentz Transformation of Kinematics
> Energy types are created to rationalize the physics laws
> p'=ɤmv
