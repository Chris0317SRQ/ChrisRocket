# How to describe a Dynamical System?
Differential Equation (DE)
## How to model a dynamical system?
1. Analyze the system
2. Find the degree of freedom(dof)
3. Derive the differential equation that of the system

## Lotka Voltarra model
dx/dt=(a-by)x
dy/dt=(-c+dx)y

# Examples
## Satellite Tumbling Motion Equation Derivation

## Rocket Motion Equation Modeling
