# 2022~2024 Building a Robust Knowledge Base
## [Study Plan](Study_Plan.html)

## Summer

### [Machine Learning](ML.md)
Machine Learning is an extremely important tool in engineering. Thus, I learn and discuss with a friend of mine from Chenggong Senior High School. We are so self-discipline that we even discuss and present regularly two times per week.
### [Fundamental of Physics](Phy.md)
```java
Tree=Physics;
Tree.Root=NTHU_AP_Phy;
DFS(Tree.Root);
BFS(Tree.Root);
```
### [Calculus](Cal.md)
```java
Tree=Calculus;
Tree.Root=NTHU_AP_Cal;
DFS(Tree.Root);
BFS(Tree.Root);
```
### [Mathematical Modeling and Control System](Control.md)
I start learning Control System since January, 2022, right after I was admitted by NCKU. I started because of the work in ADCS Design requires, which is actually an accident. However, I felt in love with Control and Guidance gradually. I decided to DFS deeper into the knowledge of Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC).
### [Kibo RPC 3rd](KRPC.md)
This is the third time I participated in the Astrobee Programming Challenge. We are a team consisted of NTUEE, NCKU, and fellows from Tunisia. Our team is divided into group Path, Motion, and Optimization. I was the team leader last year and year before and its really tired because of the extra tasks. However, I'm not this year. I'm the leader of group Path. I designed Hessian Matrix Solution to the Path optimization Mathematical Model, Edge dividing search method, and an algorithm to detect if the Path pass through KOZ.
